# AI Swarm - UI Command Line Interface

This is the command line interface for the AI Swarm. It allows you to launch the orchestrator from the command line and provides logging information.
All file operations (like config loading) are handled by this project to allow the orchestrator to run in a browser environment.

If you're looking for an easy way to get started with the AI Swarm, check out the [Conductor](https://github.com/aiswarm/conductor) project.

## Project setup for development

```
npm install
```
